You've got a list of suspicious IPs in CIDR notation. 

You need to block requests arriving from these IPs. Implement the  fun isAllowed(incomingIp: String): Boolean

You can't use 3thd party solutions



The implementation has to be in Kotlin



A working solution isn't the only requirement. The code should be simple (to read and understand), robust and testable (you don't have to write the actual tests though..).
